Polymorphic types:

- they are like containers that can hold values of different types
- this allows us to understand the properties of the container without any knowledge of the value it may hold


Test - Existential quantifucations - there exists
Types - Universal quantifications

Types give universal guarantees for all values of that types.
Types defined valid operations on terms


Types can range
(1) annoying - types definitions that are redundant and require lot of typing
(2) Useful types are those - that save errors, useful program documentation, safety net for safe refactoring
