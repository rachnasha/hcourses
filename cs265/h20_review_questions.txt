Questions:

1. How is the first query handled ? Do we pay the cost of running hueristics ? Or is the first query
 performance suboptimal.?

2. What is the basic layout that is started with ? columns based ?

3. In this example
  Query - R(a,b,c), R(d,e)
   - R(a,b,c,d,e)
  - where clause uis evaluated against ? R(d,e) ?
   - once done - the we R(a+b+c)

4. Column-major. For a column-major layout the execution strategy
of H2O materializes intermediate results from filter evaluations
into vectors of matching positions. Similarly, it handles the output
of complex arithmetic expressions. For example, in Q1 of Section 2
computing the expression a+b+c results into the materialization
of two intermediate columns, one for a+b and one for the result of
the addition of the previous intermediate result with c.

  vectors of matching positions- does it mean bit - vector ?
