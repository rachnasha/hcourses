 4. (a) A dodecahedron has 12 faces, each a regular pentagon. How many
edges does it have?

5 edges per side
12 sides per dodecahedron

each edge is shared by 2 pentagons

(5*12)/2 = 30

(b) Three faces of the dodecahedron meet at each vertex. How many
vertices does the dodecahedron have?

5 vertices per side
12 sides

each vertex is shared by 3

(5*12)/3 = 24

bottom pentagon + top pentagon  = 10 edges (2 x 5)

upper pentagons (5) (5 edges each, but we've taken one away counting the top in its entirety., So 4 x 5 = 20. -5
Total uppper disting edges = 15

lower pentagons (5) same as upper = 15

Now , we just need to subtract the edges shared by upper and lower hemispheres. 10
30


1. (( 26 ^ 3) * (10 ^ 3)) +  ( 26 ^5) + ( 36 ^ 2)

2.10^9 - 9^9 +1

3.How many anagrams does the name “hardy” have? How about the names
“littlewood” and “ramanujan?” The anagrams do not have to be dictionary
words.

hardy = 5*4*3*2*1 = 5!
littlewood = 2 = t's, 2 - o's  : 
all combinations = 10! ( these have duplicates)  - 10!/ 2!*2!

from excutive summary - The division rule: When counting, it is fine to count things more than
once, provided that everything gets overcounted the same number of
times and that you know that number and divide by it.


ramanujan - 3 - a's.: 2 - n'2 =  9!/3! * 2!
