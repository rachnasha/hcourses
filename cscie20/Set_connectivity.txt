Using set-builder notation, give formal descriptions of the following sets:
(a) The power set of a set X, denoted P(X). 
(b) The product of two sets X and Y .
(c) The difference between two sets X and Y.

(a) P(X) := ( y : y is a subset of X )   <----should be curly bracekts, but this German keyboard is hiding them from me....

(b) XxY := ( (a,b) : a in X & b in Y )

(c) X-Y := ( z : z in X & z not in Y )

4. S0 = ( e )
S1 = ( 0, 1 )
S2 = (00, 01, 10, 11)
...
each Si is finite, more precisely, card(Si) = 2^i.

So we want the cardinality of a countable collection of finite sets. This is countably infinite.

3. Using state machines, prove that every amount of postage of 12 cents or
more can be formed using just 4-cent and 5-cent stamps.

States := {(b,s,t)} where b is number of 5 cent stamps, s is number of 4cent stamps and t is the total amount of postage. b,s,t in N.

Start State := (0,3,12)
Transitions := (b,s,t) --> (0, b+s+1, t+1) if (t+1)%4=0      <---- Ek : t = 4k + 3
			(b+1 ,s-1, t+1) otherwise


(b,s,t)--->(b+1,s-1,t+1)  for s > 0
(b,0,t)--->(b-3,4, t+1)  for b > 2



Preserved Invariant: 5b+4s=t
Base case: 5*0 + 4*3 = 12 so the preserved invariant holds for the start state.
Inductive Step: Assume the Preserved Invariant is true for some state.

You have to prove that the invariant holds for (0,b+s+1,t+1) and for (b+1,s-1,t+1) when it holds for (b,s,t).

Assume the invariant holds for the state (b,s,t). Then 5b+4s=t.

We want to show 5*0+4(b+s+1) = t+1. This is equivalent to 4b+4s+3 = t, this should be equal to 5b+4s. You would have to show that 3 = b.


Module 13 has a MAJOR error:

The module claims that countably infinite sets are closed under the following operations:
-subset
-intersection
-cartesian product
-countably infinite union


The empty set is a subset of the naturals, but it is not countably infinite.

The intersection of the positive integers with the negative integers is the empty set, which is not countably infinite.
....card of the intersection could be 0, 1, 2, ...., or card(N)

A finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable. But the infinite cartesian product of the naturals with themselves is uncountable: NxNxN... <---- this is UNCOUNTABLE

Yes, the class of countably infinite sets is closed under countably infinite union.
