The domain of discourse is the set of integers. Let S(x, y, z) mean that “z
is the sum of x and y.”

(a) Write a formula that means x is an even integer.

for some x there exists w (S(x,y,z1) and S((2*w), y,z2) and z1=z2)

(b) Write a formula that symbolizes the commutative property for addition
(x + y = y + x) of integers.
For all x, all y (S(x,y,z) == S(y,x,z)

for all x , all y (S(x, y, z1) and S(y, x, z2) and z1 == z2)

(c) Write a formula that symbolizes the associative law for addition
(x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z) of integers.

for all x, y, z,( S(x, S(y,z, z1), z3) and  S(S(x,y, z2), z, z4) and z3 ==z4)

(From module #9) The domain of discourse is the set of all nite-length
binary strings as in Meyer, problem 3.21. The predicates Substring(x; y)
(meaning x is a substring of y) and Prex(x; y) (meaning x is a prex of y)
are available.
(a) Write an expression that means x consists of alternating 0s and 1s, e.g
01010 or 101010. (Hint: Consider substrings of size two.)
(b) Write an expression that means x is the binary representation of an
integer of the form 5(2k) for some integer k  0.


~(Substring(00, y) or Substring(11,y)) and (prefix(01, y) or prefix(10, y))


We define a committee to be a set of senators {S1, S2, · · · , Sn}. The predicate
M(S, c) means “Senator S is a member of committee c.” Rewrite the
following in terms of predicate logic.
(a) Every committee has at least two senators serving on it.
All(c)  there exists S1, exists S2 (S1 != S2 AND M(S1,c) AND M(S2,c)

(b) Any two distinct senators determine a unique committee.
 for all c1, for all c2 there exists s1 exists s2 exists s3 exists s4 (c1 != c2 and s1 != s3 and M(s1, c1) and M(s2, c1) and M(s3, c2) and M(s4, c2))

t.d: exists c exists s1, s2 M(s1,c) AND M(s2,c)

(c) We say two committees are “parallel” if they share no senators. Let
P(c1, c2) mean “Committees c1 and c2 are parallel.” Rewrite the following
in terms of predicate logic: Given a committee c and a senator
S not on the committee, there is some committee parallel to c of which
S is a member.

there Exists P(c, c1) ( ~M(s,c) And M(s, c1) )
