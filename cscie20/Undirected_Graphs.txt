Undirected Graphs

Determine which among the four graphs pictured below are isomorphic. If
two of these graphs are isomorphic, describe an isomorphism between them.
If they are not, give a property that is preserved under isomorphism such
that one graph has the property, but the other does not. a, b, d



Prove that isomorphism of graphs is an equivalence relation.

Reflexive  : Every graph is isomorphic to itself

Symmetric : if Graph A is isomorphic to B , then B is isomorphic to A, as they both have same number of edges and vertices.

Transitive: if graph A and B are isomorphic and graph B and C are isomorphic, then A and C are isomorphic
